I've finally done it -- beaten the last level of the game in exactly
sixteen steps.  No mean feat, as I had to control both joysticks
simultaneously, Player 1 in my left hand and Player 2 in my right.  I've
recorded the sequence of joystick positions as a gift for those who come
after.  The order in which I collected the dots must be significant because
when I entered them on the box, I heard an extended whir, followed by a
sharp click.  I wonder what horrible secret I may have unlocked...
